When you travel to a new country food might be an issue. For religious or cultural reasons, you are unable to select from our menu, please advise your nutrition representative so we may accommodate your [special request](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/patient_care/patients-visitors/admission-discharge/patient-meals.html#special).

We offer patients freedom and flexibility in both meal times and food selections: Patients can choose their meals from a wide range of delicious food items and ask for their meals to be delivered to their room at a specific time.

Patients who are scheduled for procedures, can pre-order meals ahead of time from their hospital room or from home before the admission.

Patients who need assistance ordering, can get help from a nurse and/or room service operator, or have a family member call in meal orders from home.

Your hospital menu includes nutrition information to help you identify vegetarian, heart-healthy, and other options when you order. 

What you eat plays an essential role in helping you stay healthy and manage health conditions. Heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney disease, seizure disorders and many other health problems are affected by diet.

Your physician may prescribe a therapeutic diet for you while you are in the hospital. Your meal choices are automatically adjusted so you don’t have to worry about choosing an item that is not on your diet. Your room service operator can assist you with meal selection.
