In TST Hospital we work hard to make sure than we offer highest nurse-client relationship. 

The nurse–client relationship is an interaction between a [nurse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse "Nurse") and "client" ([patient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient "Patient")) aimed at enhancing the well-being of the client, who may be an individual, a family, a group, or a community. 

**Boundaries**

Boundaries** are an integral part of the nurse-client relationship. They represent invisible structures imposed by legal, ethical, and professional standards of nursing that respect the rights of nurses and clients.

**Confidentiality**

This makes the relationship safe and establishes trust. The patient should feel comfortable disclosing personal information and asking questions.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse%E2%80%93client_relationship#cite_note-helping-6) The nurse is to share information only with professional staff that needs to know and obtain the client's written permission to share information with others outside the treatment team.

The necessary knowledge aspects that are needed to maintain a therapeutic nurse-client relationship are: background knowledge, knowledge of interpersonal and development theory, knowledge of diversity influences and determinants, knowledge of person, knowledge of health/illness, knowledge of the broad influences on health care and health care policy, and knowledge of systems.

**Self-awareness**

Self-awareness is an internal evaluation of one self and of one's reactions to emotionally charged situations, people and places. It offers an opportunity to recognise how our attitudes, perceptions, past and present experiences, and relationships frame or distort interactions with others. An example of self-awareness would be acknowledging that showing anger is not a sign of weakness, because there were emotions outside of your control.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse%E2%80%93client_relationship#cite_note-Antai-13) Self-awareness allows you to fully engage with a client and presence; being with the client in the moment, allows the nurse to know when to provide help and when to stand back.Until individuals can fully understand themselves they cannot understand others. Nurses need self-awareness in this relationship to be able to relate to the patient's experiences to develop empathy.

**Genuine, warm and respectful**

Highly skilled, experienced nurses must possess certain attributes or skills to successfully establish a nurse client relationship. Attributes such as being genuine, warm and respectful are a few to mention. An aspect of respect is respecting an individual's culture and ensuring open-mindedness is being incorporated all throughout the relationship up until the termination phase.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse%E2%80%93client_relationship#cite_note-Brown-8) The nurse works to empower the client along with their family to get more engaged in learning about their health and ways in which it can be improved. It is highly beneficial for the client to incorporate their family, as they may be the most effective support system. Revealing your whole self and being genuine with clients will accomplish the desired nurse client relationship.

Behaving therapeutically may require remaining silent at times to display acceptance, incorporating open ended questions to allow the client control of the conversation and encouragement to continue. In addition, the nurse may also reduce distance to demonstrate their desire in being involved, restating and reflecting to validate the nurse's interpretation of the client's message, directing the conversation towards important topics by focusing in on them. 

Furthermore, being polite and punctual displays respect for the client in addition to remembering to be patient, understanding, also to praise and encourage the client for their attempts to take better care of their health. A primary factor in establishing a nurse client relationship is the non-verbal message or behaviours you send out unconsciously, resulting in a negative perception and may distort your attempts in effectively assisting the client to achieve optimal health. 

**Empathy**

Having the ability to enter the perceptual world of the other person and understanding how they experience the situation is empathy. This is an important therapeutic nurse behaviour essential to convey support, understanding and share experiences. A client to a nurse in a general sense is seeking help. Patients are expecting a nurse who will show interest, sympathy, and an understanding of their difficulties. When receiving care patients tend to be looking for more than the treatment of their disease or disability, they want to receive psychological consideration. this happens through good communication, communication with clients is the foundation of care. 

During hard times, clients are looking for a therapeutic relationship that will make their treatment as less challenging as possible. Many patients are aware that a solution to their problems may not be available but expect to have support through them and that this is what defines a positive or negative experience. Empathy is used as a tool to enhance the communication between the nurse and client. Past experiences can help the clinician can better understand issues in order to provide better intervention and treatment.

**Cultural sensitivity**

Healthcare is a [culturally diverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culturally_diverse "Culturally diverse") environment and nurses have to expect that they will care for patients from many different cultures and ethnic backgrounds. Cultural backgrounds affect people's perceptions of life and health. The goal of the nurse is to develop a body of knowledge that allows them to provide culturally specific care. This begins with an open mind and accepting attitude.

[Cultural competence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_competence "Cultural competence") is a viewpoint that increases respect and awareness for patients from cultures different from the nurse's own. [Cultural sensitivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_sensitivity "Cultural sensitivity") is putting aside our own perspective to understand another person's perceptive. Caring and culture are described as being intricately linked.This is believed because there can be no cure without caring and caring involves knowing the different values and behaviours of a person's culture. It is important to assess language needs and request for a translation service if needed and provide written material in the patient's language; also, trying to mimic the patient's style of communication (such as little direct [eye contact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_contact "Eye contact"), slow, quiet).

A major obstacle to cultural sensitivity and good communication is [ethnocentrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnocentrism "Ethnocentrism"), which is the belief that one's [ethnic group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group "Ethnic group") is superior to another; this causes prejudice and stops a nurse from fully understanding the patient. Another obstacle is [stereotyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotyping "Stereotyping"); a patient's background is often multifaceted, encompassing many ethic and cultural traditions. In order to individualise communication and provide culturally sensitive care it is important to understand the complexity of social, ethnic, cultural and economic factors. This involves overcoming certain attitudes and offering consistent, non-judgemental care to all patients. Accepting the person for who they are regardless of diverse backgrounds and circumstances or differences in morals or beliefs. By exhibiting these attributes trust can grow between patient and nurse. Nurses need to know the outcome of social, cultural, and racial differences, and how they can affect the therapeutic relationship. Nurses need to acknowledge the impact of culture in order to practice health in a way that respects a person's beliefs and values.

**Collaborative goal setting**

A therapeutic nurse-client relationship is established for the benefit of the client. It includes nurses working with the client to create goals directed at improving their health status. Goals are centered on the client's values, beliefs and needs. A partnership is formed between nurse and client. The nurse empowers patient and families to get involved in their health. This relationship has three phases, a beginning (first time contact/introduction), a middle (develop a relationship to deliver care) and an end (the patient is no longer dependent on the nurse). To make this process successful the nurse must value, respect and listen to clients as individuals. Focus should be on the feelings, priorities, challenges, and ideas of the patient, with progressive aim of enhancing optimum physical, spiritual, and mental health.
