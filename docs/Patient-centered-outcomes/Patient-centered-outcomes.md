In TST Hospital we believe in the power of patient-centered approach. 

Patient-centered outcomes are results of [health care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care "Health care") that can be obtained from a [healthcare professional's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_professionals "Healthcare professionals") ability to care for their patients and their patient's families in ways that are meaningful, valuable and helpful to the patient. 

Patient-centered outcomes focus attention on a patient's beliefs, opinions, and needs in conjunction with a physician's medical expertise and assessment.

That’s why we offer individual team of medical staff, interpreter, tailored food and support of your religion views.

The overall goal of a patient-centered outcome approach to healthcare is the focus on an individual's specific healthcare needs taking into account the patient's own goals in treatment alongside the provider's best clinical expertise in the topic as a medical professional. 

Our healthcare professionals use language that the patient can understand and educate and inform their patients on all decisions made concerning our patients’ health.
