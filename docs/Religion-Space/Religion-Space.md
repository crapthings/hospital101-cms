Hospitals have increasingly added interfaith or meditation rooms in recognition of the fact that there needs to be a space for patients, their families, and hospital workers to connect with their ascribed faith. 

The diversity of religious sentiment further emphasizes the importance of having not only a space for spiritual connection, but one that is all-inclusive and allows for various forms of religious practice. 

Such spaces should also be welcoming for those who are atheists, agnostics, or do not follow any faith at all. Prayer areas in hospitals that previously may have catered to only certain faiths have even been [modified](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hospitals-revamp-chapels_n_653414) to allow for all faiths to comfortably practice. 

In TST Hospital we recognize this need and happy to provide our patients with the such private and important place. 

To many who live in a modern secular society a connection between medicine and religion is not readily apparent. To associate religion with healing seems to be an anachronism that is incompatible with scientific medicine. In fact, the two have had a close association since the earliest human attempts to heal the human body. 

In the ancient world, when little was known about medicine or the structure of the human body, healers realized that they could do little to restore health to those who were ill. The causes of disease were mysterious and often ascribed to magic or divine beings. Of common diseases only the symptoms could ordinarily be treated; for more serious conditions, healers hoped that by appealing to supernatural forces they might gain help.
