and rehabilitation services.

TST Hospital has extensive network of partner-hospitals and ready to assist our patients when needed. 

**Inpatient:** 

Patients enter inpatient care mainly from previous [ambulatory care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulatory_care "Ambulatory care") such as referral from a [family doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_doctor "Family doctor"), or through [emergency medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medicine "Emergency medicine") departments. 

The patient formally becomes an "[inpatient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpatient "Inpatient")" at the writing of an [admission note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admission_note "Admission note"). Likewise, it is formally ended by writing a discharge note. 

Health care professionals involved in rehabilitation are often involved in discharge planning for patients. When considering patient discharge, there are a number of factors to take into consideration: the patient's current state, place of residence and the type of support available.

**E-patient** 

An e-patient is a health consumer who participates fully in his/her medical care, primarily by gathering information about medical conditions that impact them and their families, using the Internet and other digital tools.

The term encompasses those who seek guidance for their own ailments and the friends and family members who go online on their behalf. 

E-patients are active in their care and demonstrate the power of the [participatory medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_medicine "Participatory medicine") or [Health 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_2.0 "Health 2.0") / Medicine 2.0. model of care. 

A growing number of people say the internet played a crucial or important role as they helped another person cope with a major illness.

Many clinicians underestimated the benefits and overestimated the risks of online health resources for [patients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patients "Patients"). Medical online [support groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_group "Support group") are an important healthcare resource.

"the net friendliness of clinicians and provider organizations—as rated by the e-patients they serve—is becoming an important new aspect of healthcare quality."

TST Hospital successfully integrated e-patient support and can provide you with full remote service based on your need. During the pandemic we have been working with out clients all around the world, supporting them online. 

**Day-patient:** 

A day patient or (day-patient) is a patient who is using the full range of services of a hospital or clinic but is not expected to stay the night. 

A walk-in clinic (also known as a walk-in center) is a [medical facility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_facility "Medical facility") that accepts patients on a walk-in basis and with no appointment required. At TST Hospital you’re welcomed for a visit without any appointment.



Patient-centered approach is our main focus and you’re allowed to come any time you feel so. Our team will serve you at any conditions and offer you a lot of alternatives if any of the services/doctors booked already. Otherwise, we offer day-treatment for our patients by appointment.
