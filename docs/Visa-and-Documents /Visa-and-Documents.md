**Visa is required for a foreign citizen to visit China**

Foreign citizens must obtain a Chinese visa before entry into China, with the exception of visa-free entry based on relevant agreements or regulations.

A visa is a travel document issued by authorized government agencies to foreign citizens applying to enter, exit from or transit through the host country's territory based on the host country's laws and regulations.

In accordance with international law and practice, any sovereign state is entitled to decide on whether or not to allow a foreign citizen to enter or exit from its territory, and whether to issue a visa, decline a visa application or to cancel an issued visa in accordance with its national laws.

Chinese consular officials are entitled to decide on the type, number of entries, validity and duration of each stay of a visa to be issued based on Chinese laws and regulations. Consular officials reserve the right to decline a visa application or revoke an issued visa.

Foreign nationals are advised not to travel unless it is necessary or urgent during Covid-19 pandemic. If you need to visit the mainland of China due to urgent humanitarian reasons or resumption of work or production, you are required to apply for a separate visa (the previous visa will not be canceled).

For urgent humanitarian reasons, please submit:

Proof of kinship: birth certificate, marriage certificate, notarial certificate of kinship, household register or other materials proving the kinship of the applicant and the invitee in China.

Hospital diagnosis documents: notice of critical illness of relatives in China recently issued by hospital, or diagnosis certificate indicating the severity of illness with official seal of the hospital.

Other supporting documents which support your emergent or humanitarian reasons.

For foreign nationals visiting the mainland of China for urgent humanitarian reasons, such as family reunion, taking care of the elderly parents, attending funeral or visiting critically ill relatives: eligible applicants are family members of Chinese citizens or foreign nationals with permanent Chinese resident permit, including spouses, parents, children and other close relatives living together (brothers, sisters, grandparents, grandchildren). In addition to the documents to prove the emergency, humanitarian needs, proof of kinship is also required.
